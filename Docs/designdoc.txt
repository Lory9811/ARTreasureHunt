# AR Treasure Hunt

## Overview
The game is played in an enclosed space (eg. at home, in an escape room) or outdoors.
The objective of the game is to find treasures hinted at by clues.
Each treasure awards the player with a clue to find the next one after compleating a minigame.
The first clue is given to the player at the start of the game.
The player has to look at the treasures with their phone to collect them.
When outdoors, the position of the player will be verified by GPS.
When outdoors, position for the next treasure will be hinted at by a compass style indicator.

The game organizers should be able to create their own treasure hunt by providing a reference picture for the treasures, hints and, if outdoors, providing the position for each treasure.
After creating a treasure hunt it should be able to be shared with players.

## Gameplay
The game is divided in two sections: the hunt itself and the minigame played when the treasure is found.
